2. **Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)
   - Your contact information

### üìß Email Template

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Firebase Auth System

```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed investigation and fix timeline
- **30 days**: Security patch release (for high/critical issues)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Severity Levels

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**

- Account takeover vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass
- Remote code execution
- Data exposure of all users

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**

- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection (if applicable)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) leading to account compromise
- Session fixation

**Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**

- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Weak encryption

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**

- Minor information leakage
- Rate limiting bypass
- UI spoofing
- Non-exploitable security misconfigurations

### üîç What We're Looking For

**High-Priority Security Issues:**

- Authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- Session management flaws
- XSS vulnerabilities that could lead to account takeover
- CSRF vulnerabilities affecting sensitive operations
- Firebase security rule bypasses
- Password reset token issues
- Email verification bypasses

**Lower-Priority Issues:**

- Rate limiting bypasses
- Information disclosure that doesn't lead to compromise
- UI/UX security improvements
- Security configuration recommendations

### üí∞ Security Bounty

While this is an open-source educational project, we recognize valuable security contributions:

**Recognition Rewards:**

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Featured in security hall of fame + detailed blog post
- **High vulnerabilities**: Security hall of fame recognition
- **Medium vulnerabilities**: Contributor recognition in release notes
- **All valid reports**: Public acknowledgment (with your permission)

### üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Contributors

**When contributing code, please ensure:**

1. **Input Validation**

   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries (if applicable)

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - Never store credentials in plain text
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow Firebase security best practices

3. **Data Protection**

   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information
   - Follow OWASP guidelines

4. **Client-Side Security**
   - Avoid storing sensitive information in localStorage
   - Implement proper CSP headers
   - Validate on both client and server side

### üîê Security Features Already Implemented

**Current Security Measures:**

- ‚úÖ Firebase Authentication with email verification
- ‚úÖ Password strength validation
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- ‚úÖ Session timeout management
- ‚úÖ XSS protection through input sanitization
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection via Firebase token validation
- ‚úÖ Secure password reset workflow
- ‚úÖ Device fingerprinting for anomaly detection
- ‚úÖ Security event logging

**Security Features in Development:**

- üîÑ Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- üîÑ Brute force protection
- üîÑ Advanced session management
- üîÑ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- üîÑ Security monitoring dashboard

### üö® Known Security Considerations

**Current Limitations:**

1. **Client-side validation only** - Server-side validation recommended for production
2. **Basic rate limiting** - Advanced rate limiting should be implemented server-side
3. **Local development** - Some security features are disabled in development mode

**Recommended Production Enhancements:**

1. Implement server-side validation and rate limiting
2. Add WAF (Web Application Firewall) protection
3. Enable advanced Firebase security monitoring
4. Implement comprehensive logging and alerting
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing
